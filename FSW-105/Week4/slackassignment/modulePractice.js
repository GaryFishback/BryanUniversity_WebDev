var calculator = require('./../calculator/calculator.js');
// NO SPACES in path! <-- IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER




//this is en empty file with nothing written but 
//the require

//as you can see this file has access to run the 
//calculator function even though the calculator function's
//code is NOT in this file but whitin another file. 


//HAVE A GREAT DAY ^^
