For this assignment, write queries using SQL to acquire data about customers, vendors, products, and employees in a fictitious sales database. 
These queries will cover many of the core aspects of writing SQL to produce data for reporting and analyzing information. 
There may be multiple ways to produce the same results, but ensure you are returning the requested fields.

Using the Sales Orders database, complete the queries below.

a. Query: SELECT VendState, VendName FROM vendors ORDER BY VendState desc;

b. Columns: 1 (states)

c. Expected Rowcount: 10 rows

3. What if we adjusted the retail price of each product by increasing it 7 percent?

4. Show a list of orders made by each customer in ascending date order.

7. What vendors do we work with that donâ€™t have an email address?
a. Query: SELECT VendName FROM vendors WHERE VendEMailAddress IS NULL ;

b. Columns:  1

b. Columns: 2

c. Expected Rowcount: 14

10. Show employees who live in the same city and state as our vendors.
